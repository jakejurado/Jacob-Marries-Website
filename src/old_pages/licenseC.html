  <h3>-License Types-</h3>
  <div>
    <p>In order to get married in California, a Marriage License is needed. There are two types of marriage licenses:
      <ul>
        <li>-Public Marriage License</li>
        <li>-Confidential Marriage License</li>
      </ul>
      Both are legal and get you married, but there are a few differences:</p>
      <ul id='compare'>
        <li>Both can be used to legally marry and both are accepted by our government.</li>
        <li>The Public License has a spots for 2 witnesses to sign, but the Confidential License does not, so you don’t need witnesses present when you get married if you purchase a Confidential License.</li>
        <li>The Public License, after it is recorded and filed away, becomes public record, so anybody can look it up and receive an informative copy.  The Confidential License does not become public record, so the information on the license can not be accessed by random people.</li>
        <li>Obtaining a certified copy of either license is the same for couples that marry, but if your kids, parents, or relatives want to buy a copy, they can only obtain one if it’s a Public License.  They would not be able to get a copy of a Confidential License unless they received a court order.</li>
        <li>Confidential Licenses cost $85, while Public Licenses cost $91</li>
        <li>Requesting a certified copy of either license requires the same fee of $15</li>
        <li>Any couple can obtain a Public Marriage License; however, there is a California Law that only allows couples who are “currently living together” to purchase a Confidential Marriage License.  <br><br>Basically, you need to be cohabitating in order to receive this Confidential License.  <br><br>Please note that the County Clerk does not verify any information, but just ask if you’re living together.  You can have different addresses on your ID’s and they don’t stipulate how long you have had to be living together, so an hour, week, or year makes no difference.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>The Confidential Marriage License was created for extra privacy.  <br><br>Police officers, correction facility workers (and celebrities too) use the Confidential License to protect their information.  <br><br>If this is a high priority then I would recommend you purchase the Confidential License over a Public Marriage License</p>

  <h3>-Obtaining A License-</h3>
  <p class='topics'><i>-where to go-</i></p>
  <p>If you are getting married anywhere in California then you can purchase a marriage license from any county in California.  If you’re coming to Los Angeles to get married, but live in northern California, you can purchase a license near where you live and bring it with you.  You cannot use a marriage license from another state.
  <br><br>If you live in Los Angeles County then there are 5 Registrar Recorder County Clerk offices that you can go to in order to obtain a Public or Confidential Marriage License.  You just have to go to their website (link), fill in their application and then go and pick it up (of course pay for it too!)
  <br><br>The Register Recorder County Clerk has a program where they allow Notary Publics, like myself, to take a special class from them so that we can issue Confidential Marriage Licenses on their behalf.
  <br><br>I have a different application that you would need to fill out and then I would bring the license to your wedding or you could come to me in Los Feliz (90027) to pick it up.
  <br><br>It’s important to note that through the Registrar Recorder County Clerk’s program, I am only able to issue a Confidential Marriage License.  You can pick up either license from their offices, but if you want me to issue you a license, then it would be a Confidential License.

  <br><br><p class='topics'><i>-What You'll Need-</i></p>
  <p>In order to obtain a license, whether it is from the Registrar Recorder County Clerk or myself, you will need:
  <ul id='needs'>
    <li class='licenseneeds'>To fill out a marriage license application <br>(The county clerk has one and I have a different one)</li>
    <li class='licenseneeds'>ID (driver’s license or passport)</li>
    <li class='licenseneeds'>A copy of any divorce papers (only if you’ve been divorced within the last 2 years)</li>
  </ul>
  <br>Once you obtain a license, you will need to have a ceremony within 90 days, otherwise the license expires and you would need to purchase another one.

  <img id='photo3' src='photos/PhotoR/l/JacobMarries_sign07.png'>
  <br><br><br><p class='topics'><i>-Certified Copies-</i></p>
  <p>After you purchase a license and have a wedding ceremony, the wedding officiant fills in the rest of the license and returns it to the Registrar Recorder County Clerk’s office.  The County Clerk then process the license and files it away.
  <br><br>They do not automatically send you a certified copy of the license, so you have to pay an extra $15 per copy.  You can prepay for this when you go to the county clerk to purchase the license or you can request a copy later.
  <br><br>I include the certified copy in my fee, so if you use me as your wedding officiant and have me issue you a license, you will automatically receive a certified copy 6-8 weeks after your ceremony.  This will be mailed to anywhere in the world.
  <br><br>If you are in a rush and need a certified copy sooner than 6-8 weeks, I suggest you pick up a marriage license from another county, like Orange, San Bernardino, or Ventura.  Either one of those counties will process your license within a week or two, sometimes just a few days.

  <br><br><br><p class='topics'><i>-Conclusion-</i></p>
  <p>If you value saving money, then it’s cheaper to purchase a confidential license from Los Angeles County yourself.  It will only cost $85.  <br><br>If you want something cheaper, then try Orange County, because they only charge $61 for a Public Marriage License.
  <br><br>If you value your time and convenience then skip dealing with the government and just have me issue you the license so you don’t have to go to the Registrar Recorder County Clerk’s office at all.
  <br><br>I charge $160 if you’re already using me as your wedding officiant or $200 if you only want to purchase the license from me.

  <ul class='faq'>Marriage License F.A.Q<br><br>
  <li class='ques'>Which is best for immigration?</li>
  <li class='ansr'>I’m not an immigration lawyer, so I really can’t answer that, but both are issued by the Government so both are recognized and accepted by the government.  I do have a suggestion if you’re in a hurry.  If you’re in a rush and you know that you will need a certified copy of your marriage license sooner than 6-8 weeks then you should pick up a Marriage License from another county.  I hear that Orange County, San Bernardino County, and even Venture County will mail you a certified copy within two weeks after they receive the license back from the wedding officiant.  Los Angeles takes 6-8 week.</li>

  <li class='ques'>  Does the certified copy come with an Apostille?</li>
  <li class='ansr'>Okay, this answer is only for couples who need to show their marriage license to a foreign government that request an Apostille. The answer is “no”. After you receive the license then you’ll need to take it to the Secretary of State regional office at 300 South Spring Street, Room 12513, Los Angeles, CA 90013. You can get an Apostille for $25. Or you can ask me to do it for an additional fee ($175).</a></li>

  <li class='ques'>How long after my wedding until I receive my certified copy?<li>
  <li class='ansr'>6-8 weeks.</li>

  <li class='ques'>What does the $160-$200 marriage license fees entail?</li>
  <li class='ansr'>$85 for the confidential marriage license.  $45 to notarize 3 signatures. $25 to prep the papers for a certified copy.  $45 for office supplies.  I give a $40 disscount if you use me as your officiant and then I also include a certified copy which will be mailed to you in 6-8 weeks.</li>

  <li class='ques'>I want you to issue me a Confidential Marriage License, so what's the next step?<li>
  <li class='ansr'>If you plan on using me as your wedding officiant, then you'll need fill out this <a href="https://app.hellosign.com/s/143cd43e" target="_blank">form</a>, so I know what what information to use when I fill out your marriage license.  I will then fill out a customer copy of your marriage license and e-mail it to you in order to make sure I spelt everything correctly.  After that, I will prepare your actual Marriage License and then bring it to you on the day of your wedding, elopement or rehearsal.  Lastly, you will sign the marriage licenes along with 3 other forms and that's it!<br><br>
  If you just need the license and already have an officiant, then fill out the form in this <a href="https://www.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=e00fe321-0866-409f-a2a9-dfcea4117cf6&env=na1&acct=1d53b6f3-4313-4213-bb96-07afcb2d8b67&v=2" target="_blank">link</a> and then send me an email letting me know when you need the license by.</li>

  <!--<li class='ques'>All this wedding info is nice and all, but do you have any games on here?</li>
  <li class='ansr'>I'm so glad you asked.  <a href='puzzle.html', target="_blank"/>Here it is.</li>
